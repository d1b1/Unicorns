They became better-known after picking up the U.S. rights to Ex Machina and Room, and worldwide rights to The Witch, growing substantially since then. They entered into deals with DirecTV Cinema and Amazon Prime in late 2013, with some films distributed through them, and the name was shortened to A24 in 2016. As of 2018, the company has received a total of twenty-four Academy Award nominations. In 2016, films distributed by A24 won Academy Awards for Best Actress (Brie Larson in Room), Best Documentary Feature (Amy), and Best Visual Effects (Ex Machina).

The company's debut drone, the R1, could track a target and film them while avoiding obstacles without any human intervention required. Then the company released the Skydio 2 in 2019, its second drone, cutting off more than half the price while improving it its autonomous tracking and video capabilities. Its flagship product, the X2, is equipped with seven cameras, 100x zoom, night vision, and promises to turn ordinary users into expert pilots thanks to its self-piloting abilities. It is backed by top investors and strategic partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Linse Capital, Next47, IVP, Playground, NVIDIA, and UP.Partners.

It promotes social experience by connecting cyclists and runners in 3D computer-generated platform. Users of the Zwift platform interact, train, and compete together by wirelessly pairing a bike trainer or treadmill to the Zwift app, to power their in-game avatars.
